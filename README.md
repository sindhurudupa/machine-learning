## Problem 1: Election Prediction Modeling
- Conducted data ingestion and descriptive statistics on an election dataset to check for null values and outliers.
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- Encoded categorical data for modeling and split the data into training and testing sets.
- Applied logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, random forest, and boosting models.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and ROC_AUC score.
- Compared models and determined the best-performing model for election prediction.

## Problem 2: Inaugural Speech Analysis
- Analyzed inaugural speeches from Presidents Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Nixon.
- Calculated the number of characters, words, and sentences in each speech.
- Removed stopwords from the speeches and identified the most frequently occurring words.
- Generated word clouds for each speech to visualize word frequency.
